        answer: '4',
        solution :'To solve for x in the equation 3(2x - 1) = 21, follow these steps:\nStep 1: Distribute the 3 on the left side of the equation to remove the parentheses.\n3 * 2x - 3 * 1 = 21\nThis simplifies to: 6x - 3 = 21\nStep 2: Add 3 to both sides of the equation to isolate the variable term (6x) on the left side.\n6x - 3 + 3 = 21 + 3\nSimplifying: 6x = 24\nStep 3: Now, you can isolate x by dividing both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for x. (6x) / 6 = 24 / 6\nSimplifying: x = 4\nSo, the solution to the equation 3(2x - 1) = 21 is x = 4.'

        answer: '±2',
        solution :'\nTo solve the quadratic equation 4x^2 - 16 = 0, you can use the quadratic formula or factor it. Let\'s factor it in this case:\n\nStep 1: Start by factoring out the greatest common factor, which is 4: 4(x^2 - 4) = 0\n\nStep 2: Recognize that x^2 - 4 is a difference of squares, and it can be factored further: 4(x + 2)(x - 2) = 0\n\nStep 3: Now, apply the zero-product property, which states that if the product of factors equals zero, at least one of the factors must equal zero:\n4 = 0 (This doesn\'t lead to a valid solution.)\nx + 2 = 0\nx - 2 = 0\nStep 4: Solve for x in each of the two linear equations:\nx + 2 = 0\nSubtract 2 from both sides:\nx = -2\n\nx - 2 = 0\nAdd 2 to both sides:\nx = 2\n\nSo, the solutions to the equation 4x^2 - 16 = 0 are x = -2 and x = 2.',

        ],  
        answer: 'y=2x - 6',
        solution :'Here\'s an explanation of the equation:\n"2x" represents twice the value of "x." You multiply "x" by 2 to get twice its value.\n"-6" indicates that you are subtracting 6 from the result of "2x," which means that "y" is 6 less than "2x."\nSo, in this equation, "y" is expressed as a function of "x," and it is equal to twice the value of "x" minus 6. This equation describes the relationship where "y" is 6 less than double the value of "x."',
