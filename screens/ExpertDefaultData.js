            {option: 'a^2+b^2-2ab'},
        ],
        answer: 'a^2+b^2-2ab',
        solution :'(a + b) 2 multiply all the variables to 2'

        ],
        answer: '13x',
        solution :'8x and 5x have the same algebraic expression, so they are like terms and be added through their coefficient. 8x+5x= 13x',

            {option: '7m-5'},
        ],
        answer: '7m+5',
        solution :'With this we need to collect the like terms so 3m+4=7m and 6-1=5 the answer will be: 7m+5',

            {option: '2x+1'},
        ],
        answer: '2x+1',
        solution :'2(x+3)-5. Multiply 2by all the variables in the parenthesis. So 2x+6-5, then simplify. The answer will be 2x+1',

        ],  
        answer: 'x=5',
        solution :'Substitute 5 to make it the value of x that will make the equation : 2(5) + 10  10 + 10 = 20  x = 20',
